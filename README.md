# EcoSortAi
The "Waste Identification and Segregation" project leverages deep learning to classify waste into four categories using a CNN model and a user-friendly React interface for real-time image uploads. Integrating TensorFlow, Keras , and Flask, the project enhances waste management efficiency and user accessibility.



#
**1) INTRODUCTION**
In the face of escalating environmental concerns, our project endeavors to usher in a new era of
waste management by harnessing the power of cutting-edge technologies. By integrating
sophisticated image processing techniques with advanced deep learning algorithms, this initiative
aims to create a highly efficient Automated Waste Identification and Segregation. The system's
primary objective is to accurately identify and categorize waste materials into distinct classes,
including dry waste, wet waste, e-waste, biomedical waste.Through this innovative approach, we
intend to not only streamline waste segregation processes but also promote recycling efforts on a
monumental scale, thereby contributing significantly to sustainable waste management practice.

**2) DATASET DESCRIPTION**
### Dataset Description for Automated Waste Identification and Segregation

In the initial phase, we obtained a dataset from Kaggle containing only organic and recyclable
waste images, totaling around 2268 images. Additional datasets were sourced for electrical and
biomedical waste from various platforms, such as Kaggle and Roboflow, amounting to
approximately 1868 images. These datasets were then amalgamated and organized into folders
based on waste categories (organic, recyclable, electrical, biomedical) to form a unified dataset.
This comprehensive dataset serves as the basis for subsequent stages in the garbage classification
project, including model training and evaluation.





#
**3) MODEL WORKING**
During this phase, the garbage classification model is constructed using Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). TensorFlow and Keras libraries play a crucial role in shaping and training the
model, enabling it to effectively categorize waste images into predefined classes. The architecture
undergoes optimization through iterative processes, including hyperparameter tuning and
regularization techniques, ensuring the model's accuracy in waste classification. This stage
establishes the groundwork for the subsequent evaluation and deployment of the garbage
classification model.
